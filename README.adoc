= TodoMoreAndroidFirebase

This is a rethinking of the TodoMore application; instead of using a local SQLite database and
a Sync Adapter, we build the whole thing using Google's Firebase (https://firebase.com).
Uses our existing data model, but is not at present miscible with our existing REST service.
